                        According to the Unsafe Driver Review by dld.utah.gov, Utah sees upwards of <b>60,000 crashes</b> on its roads and freeways every year.
                        This number is alarming and dangerous for drivers all over the state, especially the <b>younger drivers</b>. Utah has a unique set of
                        challenges when it comes to motor vehicle accidents. For example, although alcohol is a problem, it is less of a problem in Utah than <b>distracted driving</b>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This site serves as a user friendly way to display data from The Crash Studies Team at UDOT's <a href="https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/about-us/operations/traffic-safety/" target="_blank">Traffic & Safety Division</a>. The dataset
                        maintains a detailed database of all crashes on public roadways in Utah. Note that this dataset, featuring collisions from <b>
                        2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020</b>, does not include every collision from each year.

                        This site provides simple access to inform both <b>drivers and elected officials</b> of the problem that Utah faces in an
                        attempt to bring awareness and hopefully motivate drivers to decrease their distracted driving habits. Our site features a <b>calculator</b>
                        that pulls data from an <a href="https://opendata.utah.gov/Transportation/Utah-Crash-Data-2020/herb-zqda" target="_blank">API</a> for The Crash Studies Team at UDOT's Traffic & Safety Division and <b>predicts crash severity</b> based on several
                        user inputted fields.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We hope that we can bring <b>awareness</b> and <b>productive learning habits</b> through our site as we move towards safer roads for Utah. Our data shows
                        that the younger the driver, the more likely a collision will occur. Utah is family oriented, and as a result, should be focused on
                        bringing car accident numbers down.
